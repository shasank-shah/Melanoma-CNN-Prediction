## General Information
- To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
- The overarching goal is to support the efforts to reduce the death caused by skin cancer. The primary motivation that drives the project is to use the advanced image classification technology for the well-being of the people. Computer vision has made good progress in machine learning and deep learning that are scalable across domains.
- The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets were divided into the same number of images.

## Technologies Used
- python - version 3.9.18
- tensorflow - version 2.13.1
- matplotlib - version 3.8.4
- numpy - version 1.26.4
- pandas - version 2.2.1
- keras - version 2.13.1
- augmentor - version 0.2.12

## Conclusions
- Accuracy on training data has increased by using Augmentor library
- Model is still overfitting
- The problem of overfitting can be solved by add more layer,neurons or adding dropout layers.
- The Model can be further improved by tuning the hyperparameter
